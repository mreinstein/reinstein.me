  <h2> Professional Experience</h2>


  <h3 class="first">Lead Developer and Architect </h3>

  <em>Sellpoints / Syndigo Oakland, CA  <span class="date">7/2018 - present</span> </em>

  <p>
    At Sellpoints and Syndigo, I'm responsible for doing all of the frontend development of their enhanced content product,
    which runs as a third party library on almost every customer facing retail website in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    I transitioned the entire codebase from es5 to es6 using babel, removed jquery,
    re-wrote the image and video asset handling pipeline on S3 to improve bandwidth consumption, and enabled a module/nomodule
    approach to serve es6 to supported browsers. I adopted responsive images, and replaced useragent sniffing with feature detection.
    I re-wrote many of the experiences to meet ADA wcag 2.1 requirements. I led a large effort to replace font icons with svg everywhere.
    I also replaced the product's proprietary string concatenation based build system with rollup and adopted es modules. I enabled
    the usage of advanced javascript features such as async/await, and made it work even in older environments such as ie10 and up.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also helped the company transition from Sellpoints to Syndigo which involved architecting how to
    merge several redundant software systems into a unified product.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond specific libraries and frameworks, I've introduced several paradigms that have improved the way software is built.
    Using linear constraint solving I was able to build some complicated user interfaces that had previously been very difficult to
    maintain. I also formalized the concept of state machines in several modules, making some of the more complex code sections more
    robust and maintainable. I've also expanded the product's documentation, adopting a stack overflow style Q-and-A style system in
    markdown.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also handled light management duties concerning a junior developer and several contractors.
  </p>


  <p>
    Sellpoints was acquired by Syndigo in 2019.
  </p>



  <h3>Self Employed Contractor </h3>

  <h3>Lead Developer and Architect</h3>

  <em>SayMosaic San Francisco, CA <span class="date"> 10/2015 - 6/2016</span></em>

  <p>
I designed and built the entire software stack that got the company accepted into the Y Combinator program. The backend is built on AWS services (EC2, ELB, Route53, Cloudfront CDN, S3, etc.) and a number of other software packages including Redis, and RethinkDB. Designed and built several iterations of the front end using plain vanilla javascript and no frameworks to produce very minimal, performant web pages. I built and open-sourced several modules on github. I also successfully handled
certification of Mosaic products in the Amazon Echo and Nest app stores.

<p>I was responsible for maintaining a web application used by merchant partners. I used javascript, Backbone, Marionette, and heroku while maintaining the existing application. I refactored the code to use a subset of angularjs, which reduced complexity and improved modularity. I also
established automated unit tests where there were none before.</p>


  <h3>Software Consulting </h3>

Thailand, and Cambodia while working remotely.</p>


 <h3>Dev Manager, Lead Architect, Software Developer </h3>
 <em>FreeCause Boston, MA <span class="date"> 2/2010 - 10/2011</span></em>

<p>Managed 10 developers in the core technology team, which was responsible for all of the search platforms, browser plugins, e-commerce platforms, and reporting platforms that powered the various business lines. As the software architect, I was responsible for designing the components and structure of these products, their interoperability, and the technical strategy for the engineering team in general.

MapReduce service.</p>


<h3>Software Developer </h3>
 <em>Nokia Burlington, MA  <span class="date">2/2009 - 2/2010</span></em>

<p>Participated in the development of Nokia’s online store. Worked on the API team , which provides an HTTP interface between the backend services and the Nokia series 40/60 devices. The OVI store initiative was eventually scaled back and canceled, but the prototype we developed used PHP5, and Memcache for it’s caching layer. Responsibilities included requirement gathering, developer documentation, unit testing, and implementation.
Used a mix of agile, waterfall, and iterative process.</p>


<h3>Software Developer </h3>
<em>Skyhook Wireless Boston, MA <span class="date"> 3/2007 - 9/2008</span></em>

<p>Responsible for the data acquisition platform written in win32 and C# running on an iPAQ PDA. Wrote a web based management system in PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Managed an offshore team of three developers that
assisted with development.</p>


<h3>Security Tester </h3>

<p>Performed exploratory testing, threat modeling, test plan development, test execution, results analysis, and reporting for Microsoft, Compuware, Credit Suisse, and RSA. My other duties included security product research, and
the production of e-Learning materials coursework. I took initiative within the internal operations group to transition the company’s knowledge-base into a wiki. I helped maintain the company’s source control system
(Subversion) and an internal application server (LAMP stack.)</p>

<h3>Software Developer </h3>
<em>The Plum Group Boston, MA  <span class="date"> 1/2003 - 1/2005</span></em>

development, and software repository maintenance.</p>



  <h2> Personal Experience</h2>


<h3 class="first">Game Publishing </h3>
<em>Self Employed San Francisco, CA <span class="date"> 8/2014 - present</span></em>

<p>I’ve been working on shipping a game based on an idea I’ve had for a long time. The product is based on web
technology: Javascript, WebGL, and Electron as the app container. This is an extremely large project, and I work on it in a hobby capacity as time permits.</p>


<h3>Co-founder </h3>
<em>Datesite.com Boston, MA <span class="date">4/2006 - 7/2007</span></em>

<p>I created a website that allows people with mutual crushes to locate each other in a non-confrontational way. There were over fifty thousand signups which we achieved without spending any money on marketing, due to the low operating costs associated with viral growth. The application re-uses the framework that I created for Himatomo, one of my previous endeavors.
I was responsible for all aspects of the software development.</p>


 <h3>Co-founder </h3>
 <em>Himatomo.com Boston, MA  <span class="date">5/2004 - 10/2005</span></em>

phones using PHP, MySQL, and HTML. The site contained several
advanced features including a mobile blog, a college-oriented social network inspired by FaceBook,
and a location-based friend locator service. Designed clear and black box tests using PHPUnit and JUnit. I helped the business team by guiding the requirements gathering process, and the subsequent documentation. I designed the operational infrastructure to host the service in production and staging environments. Lead the internationalization team to ensure the platform reliably handled English (iso 8859-1) and Japanese (euc-jp, sjis), as well as drop-in support for additional locales.
</p>
